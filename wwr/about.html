            <h2>History</h2>
            <img src="images/rafting56_600.jpg" alt="Joyful Rafting">
            <p class="left">
                Rapids Whitewater Rafting began as a bold dream under the shadows of the Colorado Rockies.
                Founded by three lifelong friends—each with a different passion but the same love for untamed
                rivers—they believed that adventure
                should be accessible to everyone. Long summer days spent navigating wild currents became more than
                weekend fun; it became a mission.
                Working out of an old garage, they began planning routes, salvaging gear, and sketching out a vision
                where safety met adrenaline.
                Word spread fast, and soon locals lined up to experience the thrill. What started with patched-up rafts
                and handwritten maps quickly evolved
                into professionally guided tours with full safety protocols and stunning views. Every trip was a
                story—and every customer became part of the journey.
            </p>

            <p class="right">
                The founders faced setbacks: broken equipment, unpredictable rapids, and harsh winters that halted
                progress.
                But passion kept them afloat. With every obstacle came a new solution,
                and the company grew from local outings to a recognized name across the region.
                As Rapids Whitewater Rafting added expert guides, upgraded gear, and launched eco-friendly initiatives,
                its reputation soared. Families, thrill-seekers, and even scientists joined their tours—not just for
                fun,
                but for education and connection with nature. Today, their riverside outpost stands proudly as a hub of
                excitement and reflection.
                From humble beginnings to roaring success, the company stands as proof that the wildest dreams can come
                true—if you're willing to paddle upstream.
